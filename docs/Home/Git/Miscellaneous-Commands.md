### Tip (IMHO):
I recommend using the BASH emulation installed with **[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)** for performing any Git operations in a shell. There are a number of different Windows command shell options to choose from for Git. The shell that I've had the least issues with is the shell installed with the Git for Windows installation.
* It has a convenient File Explorer context menu option to open "Git Bash Here"
* Helpful syntax highlighting
* Handles copy/pasting multi-line commands correctly (something I've found other shells have issues with)
* Generally speaking on my limited experience, I've found this shell to perform as expected without issues, whereas I've experienced issues here and there when using other Git Windows shell options.
