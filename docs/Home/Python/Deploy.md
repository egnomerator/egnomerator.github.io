### Very Limited Experience
As of now, I've only ever written one Python script and it was just to create a TOC for this GitHub wiki based on the wiki's folder/file structure that I manually maintain. So, this is obviously only barely-dipping-one's-toe-in-the-water level information.

I simply used PyInstaller to create a one-folder program which I placed in `MyUser\AppData\Local`. And, then I created a shortcut to it from the Windows Start menu.
