### Research Documentation
Often, these wiki pages will simply be documentation of my general research findings. Often, they might contain and/or be entirely based on information from a lecture, blog, book, etc. My best intentions will be to cite such resources. But, generally speaking, whatever is contained in this wiki is probably not my own original content; rather, such content will almost always be based on content created by someone else. So, I'll attempt to thoroughly cite resources, and, on the rare occasions that content in this wiki is actually my own content, I probably won't bother to claim it as such; the safe assumption is someone else smarter and more experienced than me came up with the content, and I am simply trying to distill the information that impacted me most into a format that will be helpful to me as a reference in the future. And, if any of this information happens to be useful to someone else who happens upon it, that's a wonderful bonus!
